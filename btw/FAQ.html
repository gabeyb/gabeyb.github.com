                I’ve noticed all the other schools only teach for 8 hours. Why does your school require 16 hours in the
                classroom?
              </b>
              Mr. Elliott is a teacher at Shawnee Mission East High School. Fred & Amy opened Behind the Wheel, Inc. in
              1998 when the school district removed Driver Education from the curriculum. Mr. Elliott had taught Driver
              Education as a semester-long course for the district. When the couple inquired to the State of Kansas
              about
              opening a commercial school, they learned the State required only 8 hours of classroom instruction.
              Knowing
              the serious nature of driving and the fact that this course is about life and death, these parents opted
              to
              provide 16 hours of classroom instruction.
            </p>



            <p>
              <b>What can I expect in the classroom?</b>

              Students attend two 8-hour days of classroom instruction. The classroom is lecture, discussion, note
              taking
              and testing taking. Students will meet their driving instructor in the classroom setting and schedule out
              6
              hours of driving lessons to occur over 4-6 weeks. A police officer, railroad engineer, and a semi-truck
              driver all join the class to speak to students about their specific expertise adding invaluable lessons
              and
              information. Both days are required in order to complete our program and receive a certificate of
              completion.
            </p>



            <p>
              <b>What can I expect in the car?</b>

              Behind the Wheel, Inc. is completely staffed by teachers from the area school districts. Students each
              receive 6 hours of behind the wheel instruction. Typically, students go out as partners, so students
              should
              expect to observe up to 6 hours in addition to their driving time. All of our cars are late model Toyota
              Camrys equipped with dual brakes and dual mirrors. Students are taught the latest driving techniques,
              laws,
              and procedures needed to be safe and defensive drivers. Instructors pick up at home, work, school or
              anywhere
              in the Johnson County area.
            </p>



            <p>
              <b>Do I need a Learner’s Permit to begin this course?</b>

              Teenagers are not required to come with a permit; however, we strongly encourage students to attempt the
              Learner’s Permit test at least one time at the Driver License Bureau. If you pass your test and obtain a
              permit prior to class, you have the ability to begin practicing with a parent. If you do not pass your
              permit
              test, it’s okay. In fact, at least 50% fail this test. No worries, we will provide you with a certificate
              after you successfully complete the two days of classroom instruction. This certificate will get you your
              permit at the Driver’s License Bureau.

              Adults need to come with a Learner’s Permit.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Can I take your course if I live in Missouri?</b>

              Yes, we welcome students and adults from Missouri. You must come with a current Missouri Learner’s
              Permit.
              You will receive all the same thorough classroom and driving instruction. Students will need to come to
              Johnson County for driving.
